Passionate about problem solving and building things. An empathetic software engineer focusing on developing in JavaScript (Node/React/Redux) but I am language agnostic. I am currently involved in the open source community focusing on providing helpful resources for developers just like me. Most recently, I've been working with the EliteForms team to build a robust performant form library for Lit developers.
